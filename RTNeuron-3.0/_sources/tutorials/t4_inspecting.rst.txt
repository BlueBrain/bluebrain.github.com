Inspecting circuits
===================

.. admonition:: Aim
   :class: abstract

   To learn about the options available in RTNeuron for inspecting circuits.

Individual cells
----------------

Each cell can be isolated by clicking on its soma. This isolates the cell and
displays its soma, dendrites, and axon.

   :class: border

Return to the view of the whole circuit by clicking on the soma again.

Slice planes
------------

Creation
~~~~~~~~

Slice planes can be added to the view by expanding the **Slice** tab and clicking **Add**.

.. image:: /_images/slices/add.png
   :class: border

This displays a pair of planes in the view which restrict the geometry displayed.

Adjustment
~~~~~~~~~~

You can adjust the width of the slice by changing the **width** parameter in the **Slice** tab.

   :class: border

The slice can be moved clicking and dragging on the widget centred between the planes.

.. image:: /_images/slices/move.png
   :class: border

The slice can be rotated by clicking the widget centered between the planes so that it changes
to the rotation widget.

.. image:: /_images/slices/change_widget.png
   :class: border

Clicking and dragging the widget will rotate the slice.

   :class: border

The planes can be hidden by clicking **Hide** in the **Slice** tab. This will hide
the planes but retain their effect on the displayed geometry.

Removing
~~~~~~~~

To remove the planes and their effect, click **Clear**.

Background color
----------------

The background color of the view can be adjusted under the **Options** tab.

.. image:: /_images/color/color_swatch.png
   :class: border

Click in the color swatch to the right of the **Background color** label. This will show
a color selector that you can use to change the background color.

.. image:: /_images/color/set_color.png
   :class: border

The default color is white.

Cell dyes
---------

Cell dyes are not currently compatible with Sonata data.

Extra models
------------

You can load your own :file:`.obj` models into the view by selecting **Add model**
under the **Extra models** tab.

   :class: success

   You can now change how you visualize your data in RTNeuron!
