Running RTNeuron
----------------

#. Download the `RTNeuron AppImage <https://github.com/BlueBrain/RTNeuron/releases/download/3.0.0-rc1/rtneuron_x86_64.AppImage>`__
   and save it in your preferred location. In this tutorial we will assume
   this is your :file:`Downloads` directory, that is ``~/Downloads``.

   .. attention::

      RTNeuron is only supported on Ubuntu 16.04 and higher. It does not run
      on macOS or Windows, even if using a Ubuntu virtual machine.

#. To make the AppImage executable, you can use the user interface or the
   command line.

   To use the user interface:

   #. Navigate to the directory where you saved the AppImage, right click the file
      and select **Properties**

   #. Change to the **Permissions** tab.

   #. Make the file executable by selecting
      **Allow executing file as program** or setting the **Execute** dropdown
      to **Anyone**. Close the properties dialog.

   #. Right click in the directory where you saved the file and select
      **Open in terminal**.

   To use the command line:

   #. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the
      AppImage::

         cd ~/Downloads

   #. Make the AppImage executable by running the following command::

         chmod +x rtneuron_x86_64.AppImage

#. Run the AppImage by entering::

      ./rtneuron_x86_64.AppImage

#. The interactive Python shell will start. To view a circuit, run the command::

      start_app()

   This will start the RTNeuron Circuit Viewer user interface.

Loading Sonata data
-------------------

#. To visualize your Sonata data, click **Browse** and select your
   :file:`circuit_config.json` or :file:`simulation_config.json` file.

   .. admonition:: Example data
      :class: example

      If you do not currently have any Sonata data but would like to try
      RTNeuron, you can download the
      `Sonata source <https://api.github.com/repos/alleninstitute/sonata/tarball/master>`__
      which contains example data. Save the download as (or rename it to)
      :file:`sonata.tar.gz`.

      You must extract the data by running the following command from the
      terminal in the directory you downloaded it to::

         tar -xzf sonata.tar.gz

      You can now access the :file:`examples` folder, which contains the
      :file:`300_cells` example Sonata data.

#. To exit RTNeuron, close the user interface window. To exit the interactive
   Python shell either: close the terminal, or enter the following command::

      exit

.. admonition:: Congratulations
   :class: success

   You can now use RTNeuron to visualize your Sonata data!
