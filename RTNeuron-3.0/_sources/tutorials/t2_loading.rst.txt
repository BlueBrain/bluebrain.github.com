    To load a Sonata data file and understand the options.

Start RTNeuron
--------------

Begin by starting RTNeuron, you can follow the instructions in :doc:`t1_quickstart`
if needed.

Select the file to load
-----------------------

Click **Browse** in the dialog shown on screen to select the file you wish to
load.

Visualization options
---------------------

By selecting different options in the drop down box, you can change how your
file will be shown in the 3D view. The options (with example images) are:

Soma
   Selecting the **Soma** option will display only the somas in the 3D view.
   This is useful for quick visualizations not requiring dendrites or axons.

Detailed
   The **Detailed** option will display all geometry of the circuit including
   soma, axons, and dendrites.

No axon
   The **No axon** option displays the same geometry as the **Detailed** option
   with the exception that axons are ommitted.
