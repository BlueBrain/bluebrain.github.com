Fivox Documentation
===================

# Introduction

Fivox (Field Voxelization) is a library to generate volumetric images of
3d scalar fields (Local Field Potential, spike densities, voltage
sensitive dye), with loaders for the compartment, soma and spike reports
generated by the Neuron and NEST simulators used in the Blue Brain
Project. Fivox supports time animation.

Fivox can be retrieved by cloning
the [source code](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Fivox).

The voxelize command line tool can be used to generate volumes for
ParaView or other volume rendering applications. When compiled with
Livre, launch Livre with one of the URIs used by the voxelize command line tool
as the volume parameter. The fivox data source will be loaded
automatically and selected through one of the volume URI schemes.

To use the ImageSource programmatically, please refer to the @ref fivox
namespace documentation and voxelize command line tool.

## Features

Fivox provides the following major features:

* Converting compartment reports to volumetric LFP-like data
* Converting spike reports densities to volumetric data
* Converting compartment and surface area reports to volumetric data
* Time and animation support

# Installation

Build Fivox from source:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/Fivox
mkdir Fivox/build
cd Fivox/build
cmake ..
make
~~~

# Usage

The voxelize command line tool supports the following parameters:

# About

Fivox uses CMake to create a platform-specific build environment. The following
platforms and build environments are tested:

* Linux: Ubuntu 14.04, RHEL 6.6 (Makefile, x64)
* Mac OS X 10.9

The [API documentation](https://bluebrain.github.io/Fivox-0.4/index.html)
